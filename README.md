Project Overview:
This is a simple Java-based application for managing an e-commerce inventory. It helps users add, update, delete, and search for products while keeping track of the inventory. 
The project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

This system allows you to do the following things:
1 Add Products: Add new products to the inventory with a unique ID, name, price, and quantity.
2 Update Product Quantity: Change the quantity of a specific product.
3 Delete Products: Remove products from the inventory by their ID.
4 Search Products: Search for products by their name.
5 Display All Products: View all products currently in the inventory.
6 Save and Load Inventory: Save the inventory to a file and load it automatically when the program restarts.
